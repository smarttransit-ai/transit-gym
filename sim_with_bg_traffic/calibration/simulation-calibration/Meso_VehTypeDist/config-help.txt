In the config file, one line is used per vehicle type attribute. The syntax is: [param; ] <AtrributeOrParameterName>; <ValueOrDistribution> [; <limits>]

If the prefix param is given at the beginning of a line, it is assumed that the values of a vehicle parameter (given as a param child element of the vehicle element) are to be sampled. Otherwise, values of an attribute of the vehicle element are sampled. ValueOrDistribution can be a string, a scalar value or a distribution definition. Available distributions and its syntax are:

"normal(mu,sd)" with mu and sd being floating numbers: Normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sd.
"normalCapped(mu, sd, min, max)" By default, no negative values are accepted but may be enabled by setting a negative lower limit.
"lognormal(mu,sd)" with mu and sd being floating numbers: Normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sd.
"uniform(a,b)" with limits a and b being floating numbers: Uniform distribution between a and b.
"gamma(alpha,beta)" with parameters alpha and beta: Gamma distribution.
Additional options:

--output-file configures the name of the output file to be written
--name Name of the created distribution
--size Number of s to be sampled for filling the distribution
--seed Set the seed for the random number generator
Retrieving parameters from measurements of individual vehicles
To obtain mean and deviation a number of values must be obtained from the data set. The following is recommenced:

accel: the maximum (or high percentile) acceleration for each vehicle
deccel: the maximum (or high percentile) deceleration for each vehicle
speedFactor: the maximum (or high percentile) quotient of speed/speedLimit for each vehicle
